        <p class="card-text">"I've lived in this little village all my life. When my husband passed, I had to find a way to care for my young children. I started roasting nuts, using a recipe passed down through generations. Soon, people were drawn to the delicious smell and flavor. Even though my children have grown up and moved away, I still roast nuts every day. It's not just about making a living; it's about sharing a piece of our tradition with the community. My small stall is a reminder of hard work, resilience, and the bonds that tie us together."</p>
